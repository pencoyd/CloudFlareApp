#### Crowdsourced Web Security

CrowdCurity provides a platform for crowdsourced penetration testing of your web application. Many of the big guys such as [Google](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat) and [Github](https://bounty.github.com/) do bug bounty programs to leverage the power of the security researcher community to find the vulnerabilities which will unavoidingly slip through to the live web application. CrowdCurity enables you to publish and manage your own bug bounty program directly through CloudFlare in a few simple steps and totally free.
