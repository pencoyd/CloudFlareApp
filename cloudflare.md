We provide a platform for penetration testing of your web applications. Many of the big guys such as [Google](http://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat) and [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/report/bountyprograms.aspx) do bug bounty programs to leverage the power of the security researcher community to find the vulnerabilities which will unavoidingly slip through to the live web app. CrowdCurity enables you to publish and manage your own vulnerability reward programs in a few simple steps. And totally free.

We believe that by leveraging the collective intelligence of the crowd, businesses can secure their websites/web applications and create a safer internet for everybody and increase trust among their users. Therefore we want to enable both small and big businesseses to tap into the huge potential of crowdsourced security testing.
